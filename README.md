# Repro Web

This is the frontend of Repro. It is a next.js app, living at https://repro.run.

## Development

1. Ensure you have Node.js `12.8.1` installed, preferably via `asdf`.
2. Ensure you have [the `now` cli](https://zeit.co/download) installed.
3. `now dev`

## Deploying

To deploy, you must get added to the team ZEIT account. If the following instructions don't work, that's probably why. Bug Dave about it.

### To staging

`now`

### To production (repro.run)

`now --target production`
